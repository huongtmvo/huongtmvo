Hello, I am Huong Vo. 
I am learning Data Science. My passion is turning data into insights to help business and communities make good decisions.
My topics of learning are Statistics, Coding (mainly in Python and R), SQL, Data visualization and Machine Learning. 
I strongly believe that learning is lifelong and something that needs to do everyday. 
I love to use what I have learned in the field and applied them with my Data Science projects.
