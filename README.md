Hello, I am Huong Vo. 

I am a Data Science enthusiast, a self starter and a highly motivated individual. 
I am highly quantitative.

My passion is digging deep into data and turn them into insights to help business and communities make good decisions.
My topics of learning and areas of expertise are: 
 *  Programming: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Keras), R, SQL, Command Line, Git and Version Control
 *  Database/Server: MySQL, Postgres, SQL Server
 *  Competencies: Machine Learning, Data Structures & Algorithms, Probability/Statistics, Statistical Analysis, Big data, Data modeling, Data management, Data Visualization, Tableau

I write clean codes.
I strongly believe that learning is lifelong and something that needs to do everyday. 
I love to use what I have learned in the field and applied them with my Data Science and Coding projects. Check out my portfolio at [link](https://huongvo99.github.io/HuongVo_Portfolio/) 

I am currently looking for Data Science, software developer and related jobs in the Bay Area.
Shoot me a message if you think I'll fit into some related roles. :)
